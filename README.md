## Mexico's national electricity system

Mexico is composed of three independent systems:

* **BCA** which is interconnected with California, and trades energy with CAISOâ€™s market.
* **BCS** which is completely isolated and works like an energy island.
* **SIN** which is interconnected with the US, Belize and Guatemala.
